CAPH-CONTRIB 
============

This repository is dedicated to contributions to the [Caph](http://github.com/jserot/caph) system :

* platform-specific code and libraries (Quartus/Altera, ISE/Xilinx, ...) 
* tools and utilities 
* example applications
* ...

These contributions are not "officially" supported (i.e. they are not part of the Caph repository 
on Github and of the pre-compiled binaries distributed on the [Web site](http://caph.univ-bpclermont.fr).

Every Caph user is encouraged to contribute to this repository. All you need is to get a Github
account and request access to the repository (just post an
[issue](http://github.com/jserot/caph-contrib/issues) or send an email at `jocelyn dot serot at uca dotfr`) !
